# Java Secure coding guidelines

Identify and apply Java secure coding practices to reduce vulnerabilities, protect sensitive data, and harden application behaviour against common attack vectors.

**Core areas:** Input validation with type, length, format, and range checks; SQL/OS/LDAP injection defence via `PreparedStatement` and parameterized APIs; attack surface minimisation through least-privilege permissions and removal of unused features; strong cryptographic algorithms for hashing (passwords with BCrypt/Argon2), encryption (AES-GCM), and digital signatures while avoiding deprecated ciphers (MD5, SHA-1, DES); secure exception handling that logs diagnostic details internally while exposing only generic messages to clients; secrets management by loading credentials from environment variables or secret managers - never hardcoded; safe deserialization with strict allow-lists and preference for explicit DTOs over native Java serialization; output encoding to prevent XSS in rendered content.

**Prerequisites:** Run `./gradlew compileJava` before applying any changes. If compilation fails, **stop immediately** - do not proceed until the project is in a valid state.

**Multi-step scope:** Step 1 validates the project compiles. Step 2 categorizes security issues by severity (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW) and area (input validation, injection, cryptography, secrets, serialization, XSS, exception handling). Step 3 adds comprehensive input validation - type, length, format, and range - to all entry points handling untrusted data. Step 4 replaces string-concatenated queries with `PreparedStatement` or ORM parameterized equivalents to eliminate injection vectors. Step 5 audits permissions and exposed surfaces to enforce least-privilege and remove unused endpoints, libraries, and accounts. Step 6 replaces weak or deprecated cryptographic algorithms with current standards (AES-GCM, BCrypt/Argon2, SHA-256+). Step 7 sanitizes exception messages and error responses so no stack traces or internal details reach clients; aligns logging to record full diagnostics internally. Step 8 removes hardcoded secrets and replaces them with runtime secret sources (env vars, Vault, cloud secret managers). Step 9 removes or replaces unsafe Java native deserialization with JSON/XML DTO binding; adds type allow-lists where deserialization is unavoidable. Step 10 adds output encoding at all render points to prevent XSS. Step 11 runs `./gradlew clean verify` to confirm all tests pass after changes.

**Before applying changes:** Read the reference for detailed good/bad examples, constraints, and safeguards for each secure coding pattern.
