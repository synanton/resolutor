# Java ADR Generator with interactive conversational approach

Generate Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for Java projects through an interactive, conversational process that systematically gathers all necessary context to produce well-structured ADR documents.

**Core areas:** ADR file storage configuration, conversational information gathering (context, stakeholders, decision drivers, options with pros/cons, outcome, consequences), MADR template generation, and validation with `./gradlew build --dry-run` before proceeding.

**Prerequisites:** Run `./gradlew build --dry-run` or `./gradlew build --dry-run` before applying any ADR generation. If validation fails, **stop immediately** - do not proceed until all validation errors are resolved.

**Multi-step scope:** Step 1 assesses ADR preferences through targeted questions (storage location, template format) to determine scope. Step 2 generates the ADR through a conversational process: Phase 0 retrieves the current date, Phase 1 gathers information one question at a time (decision topic, context, stakeholders - deciders/consulted/informed, decision drivers, options with pros and cons, chosen option with rationale, implementation consequences), and Phase 2 produces the final ADR document using the MADR template with all collected information.

**Before applying changes:** Read the reference for detailed good/bad examples, constraints, and safeguards for each ADR generation pattern.
