description: Use when you need to apply data-oriented programming best practices in Java - including separating code (behavior) from data structures using records, designing immutable data with pure transformation functions, keeping data flat and denormalized with ID-based references, starting with generic data structures converting to specific types when needed, ensuring data integrity through pure validation functions, and creating flexible generic data access layers.

# Java Data-Oriented Programming Best Practices

Identify and apply data-oriented programming best practices in Java to improve code clarity, maintainability, and predictability by strictly separating data structures from behavior and ensuring all data transformations are explicit, pure, and traceable.

**Core areas:** Records for immutable data carriers over mutable POJOs, data-behavior separation with pure static utility classes holding operations, pure functions for data transformation that depend only on inputs and produce no side effects, flat denormalized data structures with ID-based references over deep nesting, generic `Map<String, Object>` representations for dynamic schemas converted to specific types when needed, `Optional<T>` and custom result types in validation functions instead of throwing exceptions, generic `DataStore<ID, T>` interfaces for flexible data access layers, composable `Function<A, B>` pipelines using `andThen` for explicit and traceable multi-step transformations.

**Prerequisites:** Run `./gradlew compileJava` before applying any changes. If compilation fails, **stop immediately** - do not proceed until the project compiles successfully.

**Multi-step scope:** Step 1 validates the project compiles. Step 2 categorizes data-oriented programming opportunities by impact (CRITICAL, MAINTAINABILITY, PERFORMANCE, CLARITY) and area (data-behavior separation, immutability violations, impure functions, nested data structures, generic vs specific types, validation approaches). Step 3 separates data from behavior by extracting Records as pure data carriers and moving operations to static utility classes. Step 4 establishes immutability throughout the codebase using Records, `List.copyOf()`, and `Collections.unmodifiableList()`. Step 5 extracts pure static functions for all data processing and transformation operations to eliminate side effects. Step 6 flattens complex nested object hierarchies using ID references and lookup patterns in flat `Map`-based stores. Step 7 implements generic and flexible data types starting with `Map<String, Object>` for dynamic schemas, converting to specific record types via explicit converter classes with validation. Step 8 establishes validation boundaries using pure functions that return `Optional<String>` error messages or result types instead of throwing exceptions for business validation. Step 9 designs flexible generic `DataStore<ID, T>` interfaces to decouple access logic from storage implementations. Step 10 creates composable data transformation pipelines using `Function.andThen()` with explicit tracing at each step. Step 11 runs `./gradlew clean verify` to confirm all tests pass after changes.

**Before applying changes:** Read the reference for detailed good/bad examples, constraints, and safeguards for each data-oriented programming pattern.
